# Rust-Grep

## Overview

This is a basic version of grep, used to learn how to start writing commandline
programs with Rust that is based on the project given by the rust book.

## Usage

The program accepts two commannd line arguments:

1. The first argument is the query that is being used to search
2. The second argument is the name of the file, that the content will be
searched.

## Limitations

The program currently does not support full regular expressions, and can only
service exact substring matching.
